## 🚧 What Needs to Be Implemented

### Phase 1: Recipe Access Control (NEXT)

**Goal:** Show/hide recipes based on subscription level

**Steps:**
1. Add `subscriptionLevel` field to recipes in Firestore
2. Create access control function
3. Filter recipes on recipes page
4. Show lock icon on premium recipes
5. Display upgrade modal when user clicks locked recipe

**Code needed:**
```javascript
// In recipe display function
function displayRecipe(recipe, userSubscriptionLevel) {
  const canAccess = checkAccess(userSubscriptionLevel, recipe.subscriptionLevel);
  
  if (!canAccess) {
    // Show lock overlay
    recipeCard.classList.add('locked');
    recipeCard.addEventListener('click', () => showUpgradeModal(recipe.subscriptionLevel));
  }
}

function checkAccess(userLevel, recipeLevel) {
  const levels = { 'free': 0, 'gold': 1, 'platinum': 2 };
  return levels[userLevel] >= levels[recipeLevel];
}
```

### Phase 2: Payment Integration (AFTER Phase 1)

**Goal:** Integrate Chapa payment gateway

**Steps:**
1. Sign up for Chapa account
2. Get API keys
3. Create payment initiation endpoint
4. Handle payment callback
5. Update user subscription after successful payment
6. Send confirmation email (optional)

**Flow:**
```
User clicks "Subscribe to Gold"
   ↓
Show payment form (Chapa)
   ↓
User enters payment details
   ↓
Chapa processes payment
   ↓
Webhook receives confirmation
   ↓
Update Firestore:
   users/{uid}/subscriptionLevel = "gold"
   ↓
User gets instant access to Gold recipes ✅
```

### Phase 3: Admin Panel (OPTIONAL)

**Goal:** Manage recipes and users

**Steps:**
1. Create admin authentication
2. Build recipe CRUD interface
3. Add user management
4. View payment history

#### `users` collection:
```javascript
{
  uid: "firebase-auth-uid",
